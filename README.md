## Learning C the Hard way

This is a repository for the exercises in the book "Learn C the Hard Way" by Zed Shaw. I am using this book to learn C programming. I will be adding my solutions to the exercises in this repository.

Note:
- Any exercise code that is not here is because it did not require any code to be written.
- I will be adding the code for the extra credit exercises as well.
